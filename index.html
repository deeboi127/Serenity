        <h1>My Dearest Caca,</h1>
        <div class="poem">
            <p>My world is filled with thoughts of you,<br>
            In everything I say and do.<br>
            And though you're far, I feel you near,<br>
            And wish that you were truly here.</p>

            <p>I miss the light within your eyes,<br>
            Beneath these wide and lonely skies.<br>
            I miss your head upon my shoulder,<br>
            My world without you feels much colder.</p>

            <p>You're more than just a simple part,<br>
            You are the home within my heart.<br>
            The sanctuary I long to find,<br>
            The only peace within my mind.</p>

            <p>So know this love is deep and true,<br>
            My world begins and ends with you.<br>
            And I will wait this absence through,<br>
            To find my greatest joy anew.</p>
